ArraytoBST
==========

Convert Sorted Array into Binary Search Tree
 
We find the midpoint of array which becomes the root of the array. Then we recursively create the left and right child
as the left portion will be less than root and right portion of the array will have all elements higher than root.
Please look at the java file for implementation.
